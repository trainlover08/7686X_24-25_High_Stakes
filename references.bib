  abstract = {Generally, the addition of Chromium (Cr) into the dual-phase (DP) steels can suppress bainitic transformation. In this work, the continuous hot-dip galvanization of DP980 steel is thermally simulated with various Cr contents of 0/0.3/0.6 wt.\%, and the effect of Cr on bainitic transformation and properties of steels is studied. The results indicate that the bainitic transformation is obviously inhibited. The fraction of bainite decreases with the increasing Cr content. The incubation time is prolonged in the 0.6Cr steel with a slower bainitic transformation rate. Compared to that of 0 and 0.3Cr steels, the 0.6Cr steel exhibits a high tensile strength of 1033 MPa and uniform elongation of 9.1\% due to the rapid strain-hardening rate. As a result, the mechanical properties of 0.6Cr steel satisfy the requirements of hot-dip galvanized DP980 steel.}

  abstract="Automated machine learning (AutoML) is an increasingly popular approach for selecting learning algorithms and for configuring their hyperparameters in an effective, principled and fully automated way. So far, AutoML techniques have been focussed primarily on supervised learning scenarios. In this work, we extend AutoML to semi-supervised learning. Specifically, we propose co-ensembling, a generic procedure that uses unlabelled data to enhance the performance of high-quality ensembles of learners obtained from a state-of-the-art supervised AutoML system. Co-ensembling can be applied to any set of two or more base learners, and bypasses direct exploration of the large design space of semi-supervised learning algorithms. We demonstrate substantial performance improvements on multiclass classification problems by applying a single iteration of co-ensembling. On a large, diverse suite of multiclass data sets, single-step co-ensembling yields improved performance on 75{\%} of the multiclass problems we considered, and achieves an average relative reduction in error rate of 7{\%}.",
